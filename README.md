# ConcreteCompressiveStrength\
\
In this project, I'll look at the <i>Concrete Compressive Strength Data Set</i> from the UCI repository. \
\
This data set was uploaded by Prof. I-Cheng Yeh and used mainly in Prof. I-Cheng Yeh's 1998 paper (I-Cheng Yeh, "Modeling of strength of high performance concrete using artificial neural networks," Cement and Concrete Research, Vol. 28, No. 12, pp. 1797-1808 (1998).)\
\
This data set is concerned about predicting concrete compressive strength with 8 different variables (i.e. input features) involved in concrete admixing. 7 of these variables are cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate. The last input feature is the age of concrete.\
\
I'll be analyzing the data set and developing models to predict concrete compressive strength. Although I load the data directly from the UCI repository online, you can find Prof. I-Cheng Yeh's original data set and original README file with the names <i>Concrete_Dta.xls</i> and <i>Concrete_Readme.txt</i> respectively in this repo.
